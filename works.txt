1. Null attributes in dimensions:
-> recommend substituing a descriptive string, such as Unknown or Not Applicable in place of the null value
? because different databases handle grouping and constraining on nulls inconsistenly
[NOT YET]

2. Date Table
-  has many attributes describing characteristics such as week number, month name, fiscal period, and national holiday indicator
-> primary key of date dimension can be more meaningful, such as an integer representing YYYYMMDD, instead of a sequentially-assigned surrogate key
? to facilitate partitioning
-> when precision is needed, a separate date/time stamp can be added to the fact table
? for part grouping or shift number, then you would add a seperate time-of-day dimension foreign key to the fact table

3. Implement SCD5
